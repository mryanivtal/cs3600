    "    This option increases the receptive field linearly - each additional layer increases the receptive field size by the kernel size.\n",
    "    This also typically adds a nonlinear layer (RELU etc.) per layer, making the network more complex.\n",
    "2. **Add pooling layers with corresponding stride** - RF grows with no. of pooling layers multiplicatively, becasue each pooling layer multiplies the RC by the pooling size. Note that without the stride, pooling layers will not multiply the RF, because neighbouring points will have almost the exact same RF, so pooling them together will not chnage much.   e.g. - adding a pooling layer with kernel 2 and strde 1 will change the RF from x to x+1 in each dimension, because the rest of the points in the origin space will be be the same.\n",

It generally converges faster than regular GD (With reasonable number of samples per batch) and is less jumpy than the SGD, because the gradients are averaged over several samples.\n",
